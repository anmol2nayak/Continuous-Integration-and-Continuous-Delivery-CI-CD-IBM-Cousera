🚀 Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD)

This project demonstrates the end-to-end implementation of a CI/CD pipeline using modern DevOps practices.
It automates the process of building, testing, and deploying applications through tools like Tekton, Argo CD, and OpenShift Pipelines.

🧩 Overview

The project showcases how software can be built, tested, and delivered automatically with minimal manual intervention.
It highlights Continuous Integration (CI) to ensure reliable builds and Continuous Delivery (CD) for rapid, secure deployments.

⚙️ Tech Stack

Tekton Pipelines – For defining and automating build/test steps

Argo CD – For GitOps-based continuous delivery

OpenShift Pipelines – Kubernetes-native CI/CD automation

GitHub – Version control and collaboration

YAML – Declarative configuration for pipelines and tasks

🧠 Key Features

Automated build, test, and deployment stages

Reusable Tekton tasks for code management and deployment

GitOps workflow using Argo CD for declarative deployments

Secure, version-controlled pipeline configurations

Integration with OpenShift for containerized deployments

🏗️ Workflow

Code Commit: Developer pushes code to GitHub.

Build Trigger: Tekton Pipeline automatically builds and tests the application.

Image Build: Container image is generated and stored in the registry.

Deployment: Argo CD deploys the latest version to the OpenShift cluster.
